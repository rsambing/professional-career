## 🎤 Let’s start with something simple… but important:

**Introducing yourself in a tech interview.**

We’ve all been there — the interviewer says:  
> “Tell me about yourself,”

… and suddenly your mind goes blank or you start listing random facts. 😅

But here’s the truth: **this moment is your first impression**, and you want it to be strong, clear, and confident.

---

## ✨ Here’s how to do it right:

✅ Keep it short (1–2 mins max)  
✅ Highlight your background, relevant experience, and interests  
✅ Focus on what makes you a good fit  
✅ Show a bit of your personality – they’re hiring a person, not a robot 😉

## 💡 Try this structure: **PPAF Framework**

1. **Present** – Who you are  
   _Example: Name, university, field of study_
2. **Past Achievements** – What you’ve done  
   _Example: Projects, internships, programming languages you’re confident with_
3. **Ambition / Future** – What you’re looking for  
   _Example: Learning opportunities, internships, growth, challenges_
4. *(Optional)* **Fun Fact or Trait** – Something memorable or humanizing

---

This is your chance to set the right tone and energy for the rest of the interview.  
Practice it until it feels natural and confident!
