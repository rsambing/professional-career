🧠Weekly Insight | Vol. 1
🔹 Topic: How to Introduce Yourself in Tech Interviews

Hey A2SV family! 👋

Welcome to our very first Weekly Insight,  a new series where we share practical tips to help you grow as a tech professional. Whether you're just getting started or preparing for your next big opportunity, these weekly drops are for you.

Let’s start with something that seems simple but can actually make a big difference,
Introducing yourself in a tech interview.

We’ve all been there,  the interviewer says “Tell me about yourself,” and suddenly, your mind goes blank or you start listing random facts. 😅

But here’s the truth: this moment is your first impression, and you want it to be strong, clear, and confident.

✨ Here’s how to do it right:
• Keep it short (1–2 mins max)
• Highlight your background, relevant experience, and interests
• Focus on what makes you a good fit
• Show a bit of your personality , they’re hiring a person, not a robot 😉

💡 Try this structure - PPAF Framework
1. Present – Who you are (name, school, what you're studying)
2. Past Achievements – What you’ve done (projects, internships, languages you’re good at)
3. Future – What you’re looking for (growth, challenge, internships, etc.)

This is your chance to make a strong first impression and set the right energy for the interview.

Practice it until it feels natural and confident!
