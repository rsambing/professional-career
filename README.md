## 💡 Why I Created This Repo

I wanted a clean and organized space to track my professional development — a place where I can:

- Store and update my resumes
- Prepare for interviews and job opportunities
- Reflect weekly to measure my progress
- Share useful resources and materials
- Stay accountable and consistent

This repo is part of a bigger personal learning ecosystem I'm building.

If you're interested in how I'm training my problem-solving skills, check out my other repo:  
👉 [`junior-training-sheet-solutions`](https://github.com/rsambing/junior-training-sheet-solutions)

That project contains my personal solutions to the **Junior Training Sheet V7.0**, created by Dr. Mostafa Saad Ibrahim.  
It’s designed to help beginners in competitive programming improve their skills through a structured and progressive set of problems across different platforms.

## 🌱 Final Thoughts

This repo is not just about files — it's about building discipline, resilience, and confidence in my career journey.  
Whether you're a beginner, student, or working professional, I hope this inspires you to document and share your own growth too.
