# Professional Career

This repository contains all the important files and notes Iâ€™m using to grow as a software engineer.

## Folders

### `resumes/`
My up-to-date resumes in both Portuguese and English.

### `interviews/`
Materials to help with job interviews and weekly insights I write to track my progress.

## Why I created this repo

I want to organize my journey as a developer and keep everything in one place: resumes, notes, career tips, and self-reflection.  
By sharing this, I also hope to help and inspire others in the same path.
